## Contribution Guidelines and Best Practices:

- PLEASE make sure the app renders/runs properly before pushing to master.  If you're hesitant or not sure, do a pull request instead.

- Put comments in code and update docs if you've written complicated logic

- We will style this web app mostly with `bootstrap`, `react-bootstrap` and `font-awesome`, if CSS is used, try to keep it organized and modular, and try to declare CSS elements inside the component you're trying to style.

- Let's make this s*** so we can play this game and bring back all the memories!!!

## Updates:

- 11/23 coin logic is done
