## Contribution Guidelines and Best Practices:

- PLEASE make sure the app renders/runs properly before pushing to master.  If you're hesitant you might break the app, do a pull request instead.

- We will style this web app mostly with `react-bootstrap` and `font-awesome`, try to avoid using CSS as the main styling method, if CSS is used, try to keep it organized and modular, and try to declare CSS elements inside the component you're trying to style.

- Let's make this s*** so we can play this game and bring back all the memories!!!
