##Contribution Guidlines and Best Practices:

- PLEASE make sure the app renders/runs properly before pushing to master.  If you're hesitant, do a pull request instead.

- We will style this web app mostly with `react-bootstrap` and `font-awesome`, try to avoid using CSS as the main styling method, if CSS is used, try to keep it organized and modular

- Let's make this s*** so we can play this game and bring back all the memories!!!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
